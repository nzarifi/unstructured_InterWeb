       "[Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nBiden looks to use abortion rights to put Florida in play in November\\n\\nBy Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        3:53 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden visited his rival’s home turf in Florida on Tuesday, where his team is seeking to leverage a restrictive abortion law to visit put the state in play for Democrats, seeing reproductive rights as a galvanizing issue for voters one week before a restrictive abortion ban in that state goes into effect.\\n\\nDemocrats have seized on abortion ahead of November,\\xa0hoping it\\xa0could spur moderate voters – particularly women – to turn out in droves against former President Donald Trump by tying the abortion bans directly to him.\\n\\n“Donald Trump stripped away the rights and freedoms of women in America,” Biden said in Tampa on Tuesday, adding it will be “on all of us” to restore those rights.\\n\\n“And when you do that, it will teach Donald Trump and extreme MAGA Republicans a valuable lesson,” Biden added. “Don’t mess with the women of America.”\\n\\nBiden’s campaign often cites Democratic successes in the 2022 midterms and off-year elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned as examples of the issue driving voters to the polls.\\n\\nAnd they’ve put a renewed focus on Florida following a pair of state Supreme Court rulings this year – one paving the way for a six-week abortion ban in Florida, the other giving Floridians a chance in November to enshrine abortion access in the state’s constitution. Biden campaign officials and Democratic strategists are hoping elevating the issue in the state will help drive voter turnout and potentially deliver the state for Biden.\\n\\nLast year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, making it one of the most restrictive states in the country to obtain an abortion. The ban will go into effect May 1 after the state Supreme Court\\xa0recently overturned decades of legal precedent in the state that protected abortion through the second trimester of a pregnancy.\\n\\nBut even as Biden’s campaign believes that ban will galvanize left-leaning and moderate Florida voters, they face an uphill battle if they seek to flip that state, which has become a reliably red bastion for the MAGA movement and has turned sharper to the right since 2020. Trump and many of his family members and allies from his time in the White House have made the state their home in recent years.\\n\\nBiden’s Tuesday trip is part of a strategy by his campaign to keep abortion at the forefront, arguing that it’s part of a broader threat to personal freedoms and health care. In an example of how salient an issue abortion is for the campaign, Biden and\\xa0Vice President Kamala\\xa0Harris’ first joint campaign appearance this election year was focused on reproductive rights.\\n\\nIn Tampa on Tuesday, Biden repeatedly needled both Trump and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who argued when Roe was overturned that the high court should consider revisiting rulings that provide the federal right to contraception and same-sex marriage.\\n\\nBiden poked fun at the former president during his remarks for describing “the Dobbs decision as a miracle,” a reference to the 2022 decision that led to Roe’s reversal.\\n\\n“Maybe it’s coming from that Bible he’s trying to sell,” Biden joked. “I almost wanted to buy one to see what the hell’s in it. Folks, it was no miracle – it was a political deal to get rid of Roe – a deal, a political deal he made with the evangelical base of the Republican party.”\\n\\nDuring Tuesday’s event, Biden also invoked the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision to revive a 160-year-old law barring all abortions except in cases when “it is necessary to save” a pregnant woman’s life.\\n\\n“Trump has literally taken us back 160 years,” Biden said. “He says it’s up to the states – this is all about state’s rights. But he’s wrong. The Supreme Court was wrong. This should be a constitutional right in the federal Constitution.”\\n\\n“This isn’t about state’s rights,” Biden added, “it’s about women’s rights.\\n\\nIn\\xa0a\\xa0recent stop in Arizona, Harris, who’s crisscrossed the country to talk about reproductive rights, cast restrictive abortion laws as “Trump abortion bans.” She continued that pitch on Monday in battleground Wisconsin – advancing the Biden campaign’s “split screen” as Trump sat in court.\\n\\nTrump has shifted his abortion position over the last two decades, and most recently, argued that abortion legislation should be left to the states. But Trump’s own status as a Florida resident means he will have an opportunity to directly weigh in on the abortion referendum in November. His advisers have not said how he’ll vote.\\n\\nDemocrats have struggled to find success in Florida, which has voted\\xa0Republican in the last two\\xa0presidential\\xa0elections and has shifted to the right. Biden lost Florida voters 65 and older to Trump by 10 points in 2020, a wider gap than his 5-point deficit nationally.\\n\\nBut there are some signs that the campaign could shift in his favor: The state’s 2024 ballot\\xa0will\\xa0include referendums to legalize recreational marijuana and expand abortion access through state constitutional amendments, which could energize Biden’s base.\\n\\n“The last time there was an abortion referendum on the ballot, in 2012, President Obama won the state. So, with our enormous financial advantage, Biden-Harris campaign can afford to invest in many paths to victory and that includes Florida,” Tyler said.\\n\\nPrivately, though, Democrats here acknowledge turning the state blue this cycle remains a herculean task and success may be defined by how much they can force Trump to spend in Florida to protect his advantage here.\\n\\nDuring Biden’s last trip to Tampa, in early 2023, he\\xa0railed\\xa0against GOP efforts to curb entitlements, drawing a contrast with the state’s GOP Sen. Rick Scott, who made a proposal to sunset federal legislation – including Social Security and Medicare – every five years. Florida has the highest population of seniors of any state.\\n\\nAbortion rights, social security and Medicare, among other issues, were listed in a recent campaign memo, arguing that Biden has an opening in Florida and laying out investments in the state.\\n\\nIn late January, Biden told a group\\xa0of donors at a high-dollar fundraiser in south Florida that he believes he can win the Sunshine State.\\n\\n“I think we can win Florida,” he said Tuesday in Jupiter, Florida, about 20 miles from his predecessor’s Mar-a-Lago resort.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

       " Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nCDC issues health advisory about risks of counterfeit or mishandled Botox injections\\n\\nBy Jacqueline Howard, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        3:24 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory Tuesday about the risks of counterfeit or mishandled Botox injections after dangerous fake versions of the product have been found in several states.\\n\\nThe CDC, the US Food and Drug Administration and state and local officials are working to investigate clusters of at least 22 women who have reported harmful reactions after receiving counterfeit Botox injections, injections from unlicensed or untrained providers or shots in places that were not health-care settings, such as spas or private homes, according to the official CDC health advisory.\\n\\nAs of Thursday, those incidents have been reported in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York City, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Among the people who reported symptoms, 11 were hospitalized, the CDC said, but none have died.\\n\\nThe patients, ages 25 to 59, reported their symptoms between November and March, and most of them – 91% – reported receiving Botox for cosmetic purposes, according to the CDC. Their symptoms included blurred vision, drooping eyelids, dry mouth, slurred speech, shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness. Seven of them were tested for botulism. Test results were negative for six, while one is still pending.\\n\\nThese incidents appear to be connected to products that have been purchased from unlicensed sources and then administered by either unlicensed or licensed providers, according to a previous FDA announcement. The agency warned health-care professionals that purchasing and administering counterfeit products puts patients’ health at risk.\\n\\nThe counterfeit Botox products may be identified by the lot number C3709C3 on the outer carton and vial, according to the FDA.\\n\\nThe outer carton also may display the active ingredient as “Botulinum Toxin Type A” instead of “OnabotulinumtoxinA.” The carton and vial may indicate 150-unit doses, which is not a dosage made by the companies AbbVie or Allergan, the FDA said, and the outer carton may contain language that is not English.\\n\\nIn Tuesday’s advisory, the CDC noted that when botulinum toxin, known as Botox, diffuses around the site where it was injected, it can result in adverse effects.\\n\\n“Botulism is the disease caused by botulinum toxin circulating in the blood and producing effects remotely from the injection site. There may be symptom overlap between the presentation of localized adverse effects from injection of botulinum toxin, especially in the head and neck, and the early symptoms of botulism,” according to the advisory.\\n\\n“Clinicians and health departments should consider the possibility of adverse effects from botulinum toxin injections in patients presenting with localized paralysis,” the advisory says. “Clinicians should immediately contact their state, tribal, local, or territorial health department if they suspect botulism.”\\n\\nBotulism can be treated with an antitoxin, according to the CDC. That’s why it’s important to get medical care quickly and early in the course of the disease. If the disease is left untreated, it may progress to paralysis and other complications.\\n\\n“Botulinum toxin should be administered only by licensed providers, using only recommended doses of FDA-approved botulinum toxin, preferably in a licensed or accredited healthcare setting,” the CDC advisory says. “Providers should be trained in the proper administration of botulinum toxin, practicing in accordance with state and local requirements.”\\n\\nIn response to the reports of counterfeit Botox, the companies behind the FDA-approved versions, AbbVie and Allergan Aesthetics, said in a statement that they are the only authorized suppliers of Botox in the United States.\\n\\n“Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, has a comprehensive supply chain security program to ensure that all products manufactured are safe, secure, and sold through authorized distribution channels.\\xa0All reports of counterfeit product are thoroughly investigated by our team and in conjunction with law enforcement and public health authorities where appropriate,” the statement says.\\n\\nProviders and consumers can identify authentic Botox products by a tamper-evident seal on the packaging, the name “onabotulinumtoxinA” listed under the brand name Botox and a hologram of the word “Allergan” on the vial label.\\n\\nBotox is a brand name for botulinum toxin, which in small doses can temporarily treat medical or cosmetic concerns such as severe underarm sweating, chronic migraines, overactive bladder and facial wrinkles.\\n\\n“Botox and its peer brands provide a dilute, precise, and consistent amount of botulinum toxin, whereas knock-off unregulated products are not reliably manufactured or subject to the same quality assurance, which can lead to over or underdosing,” Dr. Michael Cameron, president and founder of\\xa0Cameron Dermatology\\xa0and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, said last week.\\n\\nWhen in the body at high levels, the toxin botulinum can cause the rare but serious illness\\xa0botulism or symptoms similar to those from the illness.\\n\\n“Signs and symptoms of botulism include muscle weakness, vision changes, slurred speech, difficulty moving your eyes. An emergency would be if you start to have difficulty breathing,” Cameron said.\\n\\n“I personally recommend if you’re getting Botox for your wrinkles, you go to a board-certified dermatologist. If you’re getting Botox for your migraines, you go to a neurologist. If you’re getting Botox for your bladder issues, you go to your urologist,” he said. “If you feel like there’s any risk or the pricing doesn’t really make sense, then you could just ask to actually see the vial and inspect the vial of Botox yourself.”\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

       " Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nOpinion: What’s happening at Columbia is a disgrace\\n\\nOpinion by Jonathan A. Greenblatt\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        4:16 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nOn Sunday, I went to Columbia University just uptown from my office to see for myself what is happening there.\\n\\nAs I approached the gates of the university, I saw\\xa0a seething protest.\\xa0Drums and chants rang down Amsterdam Avenue. Crowds on both sides of the fence egged each other on, repeating\\xa0calls\\xa0for\\xa0intifada\\xa0and revolution.\\n\\nAnd yet the most sobering experience came from a listening session hosted in the Hillel by the\\xa0Columbia Task Force on Antisemitism. Approximately 80 Jewish students from across the university came to tell their stories about their encounters with\\xa0anti-Israel\\xa0protesters, crowding into a room. Some were crying. Some were yelling in anger. They shared individual stories, each more harrowing than the previous one.\\n\\nStudents\\xa0told me of\\xa0having\\xa0liquids flung at them\\xa0and\\xa0getting screamed at\\xa0for simply wearing a\\xa0Jewish star.\\n\\nStudents illustrated the madness by showing me videos on their phones. One depicted the assault of a Jewish classmate,\\xa0an Israeli flag ripped from his hand. Another showed a Jewish student being screamed at by a\\xa0fully\\xa0masked individual who came right up to his face, his voice shaking with fury.\\n\\n“Al-Qasam’s next targets,”\\xa0a reference to\\xa0an\\n\\narmed wing of Hamas. I saw images of\\n\\noversized posters\\xa0planted on the Columbia quad, each lionizing men\\n\\nIsrael\\xa0viewed\\xa0as\\n\\nterrorists. Demonstrators calling openly for Hamas to burn\\n\\nTel Aviv.\\xa0Others yelling that\\n\\nOctober 7\\xa0is about to be every day.\\n\\nTo be fair, it is not clear that all of those harassing and assaulting Jewish students are Columbia students. It is quite clear that campus outsiders — even high-profile critics of Israel like\\xa0Mohammed el-Kurd,\\xa0Norman Finkelstein\\xa0and\\xa0Nerdeen Kiswani\\xa0— are abundant on campus.\\n\\nBut maybe the most jarring moment came when I left the Hillel building. Standing on the corner, a young woman I had seen during the listening session approached me. She introduced herself and literally broke down in tears. She sobbed and sobbed, overcome by exhaustion, and expressed what I heard throughout the afternoon: anguish, desperation, fear.\\n\\nWhat I saw in Morningside Heights felt like a postcard from the future, a glimpse of what\\xa0lies ahead if we don’t get our arms around this problem without delay. That’s because I have seen firsthand how this situation is\\xa0unfolding at numerous campuses\\xa0across the country. And I’m not talking about protests — I‘m talking about sheer, unfettered rage.\\n\\nAnd we\\xa0shouldn’t kid ourselves. While not all of the protestors are violent, the repeated calls of “free Palestine” or “ceasefire now” are not about the legitimate claims of one group of people. They are about\\xa0marginalizing a group of people, forcibly silencing and shoving them out of public spaces — not because of what they might believe, but simply because of who they are.\\n\\nColumbia is a preview of a future where persecution has been\\xa0normalized. This is not some parochial concern. Virulent antisemitism\\xa0clearly is a problem on its own, but it also is a harbinger of other forms of hate. In that vein, this virus will spread and other minorities will be targeted.\\n\\nFor all of these reasons, it\\xa0is time for immediate and swift action\\xa0at Columbia\\xa0and across the country.\\n\\nFirst, Columbia\\xa0President Minouche Shafik\\xa0may be doing her best, but she\\xa0should\\xa0invite the\\xa0NYPD back onto her campus\\xa0to provide the protection that campus security has failed to deliver. And college presidents across the country need to engage with local law enforcement now to develop plans to ensure the safety of their Jewish students. No one should wait for a tragedy to happen in order to take action.\\n\\nSecond, no university should permit full-face masking on their campus. This would not jeopardize the health of any persons — you could wear a medical mask to prevent the spread of viruses like Covid. But entire face coverings intended to disguise an individual should not be allowed on any university environment.\\xa0This is not a free speech issue. It’s a public safety imperative.\\n\\nThird, we\\xa0should\\xa0reinstitute deterrence: a one-strike policy for those who violate the rules or who break the law. If one student violates the code of conduct, we need the imposition of drastic sanctions, including suspension. If a non-student enters campus and engages in violative behavior, they should be arrested for trespassing, let alone other offenses as appropriate. If local police are on site, this will be easy to implement.\\n\\nFinally, donors, alumni and parents need to demand action — and to take action themselves. Every single donor who cares about\\xa0this issue, who treasures their campus, needs to engage. Stopping funds\\xa0will get attention. Diverting funds to support nonprofit organizations like the\\xa0Community Security Service\\xa0that train volunteers to protect Jewish students, or to universities specifically to support the security of Jewish students on campus,\\xa0could be even more effective.\\n\\nI anticipate that some critics, even some students, will protest. First, they will gaslight the Jewish victims and complain that it’s the agitators who are suffering from political persecution. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Just because someone says the earth is flat does not make it so.\\n\\nOthers will\\xa0contest that these guidelines would turn a campus into a police state.\\xa0However, campuses cannot be lawless zones where anarchy reigns. Jewish students need to be protected.\\n\\nAlready, agitators are threatening\\xa0to replicate\\xa0Columbia-style protests\\xa0at other institutions,\\xa0and indeed it is already happening at places such as Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before this happens, schools need to reassert some measure of authority and retake their campuses\\xa0from these\\xa0anti-Israel\\xa0protests.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

       " Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nMillions more salaried workers will be eligible for overtime pay under final Biden administration rule\\n\\nBy Tami Luhby, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        3:19 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nMillions of salaried workers will soon qualify for overtime pay under a final rule released by the US Department of Labor on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe new rule raises the salary threshold under which salaried employees are eligible for overtime in two stages. The threshold will increase to the equivalent of an annual salary of $43,888, or $844 a week, starting July 1, and then to $58,656, or $1,128 a week, on January 1, 2025.\\n\\nAbout 4 million more workers will qualify for overtime when the rule is fully implemented in January, the agency estimates. In its first year, the rule is expected to result in an income transfer of about $1.5 billion from employers to workers, mainly from new overtime premiums or from pay raises to maintain the exempt status of some affected employees.\\n\\n“This rule will restore the promise to workers that if you work more than 40 hours in a week, you should be paid more for that time,” acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a statement. “Too often, lower-paid salaried workers are doing the same job as their hourly counterparts but are spending more time away from their families for no additional pay. That is unacceptable.”\\n\\nThe current threshold is $35,568 a year, or $684 per week, which was put in place by the Trump administration in 2019.\\n\\nThe salary threshold will be updated every three years, starting July 1, 2027, the agency said.\\n\\nBusiness groups are expected to fight the effort, as they successfully did when the Obama administration attempted to significantly hike the threshold. Trade associations quickly pushed back on the latest proposed rule when it was released in August, saying it would raise their members’ costs and hurt their operations.\\n\\n“I suspect that such substantial increases may be a particular burden for many smaller businesses, forcing some to choose between cutting jobs and raising prices,” said Ted Hollis, a partner at Quarles & Brady, a law firm. “Some businesses that cannot do either may be forced to close, resulting in unintended but predictable side effects of this government action.”\\n\\nIn 2016, then-President Barack Obama asked the Labor Department to overhaul federal overtime rules and\\xa0raise the salary threshold to $47,476 a year, or $913 a week. That would have roughly doubled the level that was in place at the time.\\n\\nBut business groups and 21 states sued, and later that year, a\\xa0federal judge in Texas issued an injunction. The Trump administration said in 2017 that it would not defend the rule\\xa0and later lifted the threshold to the current level.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

The siblings were identified Monday by the sheriff’s office as Alanah Phillips and her brother Zayn Phillips. Police initially said the boy was 5 years old.\\n\\n\\ufeffOn Tuesday, prosecutors identified the driver as Marshella Marie Chidester, a news release from Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney Jeffery A.

Today is the Senate’s turn to act.”\\n\\nThe legislation ties together four bills that the House voted on separately in a rare Saturday session, providing nearly $61 billion in aid for Ukraine, over $26 billion for Israel and more than $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. The first three bills are very similar to the package that the Senate passed earlier this year, which House Speaker Mike Johnson had originally refused to bring to the House floor.\\n\\nThe fourth bill increases sanctions on Russian assets and contains language that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the US. It gives Chinese parent company ByteDance roughly nine months to sell TikTok, or the app will be banned from American app stores.\\n\\nWhile the chamber is expected to have enough support from both parties to pass the legislation, the exact timing for a final vote remains a question as any one senator can slow the process before sending the package to President Joe Biden for his signature, though it is expected to pass by midweek.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, a procedural vote advanced with wide bipartisan support, 80-19, telegraphing that the legislation should easily pass once a final vote occurs.\\n\\nSenate leaders are trying to cut a deal allowing for a final vote sometime Tuesday, according to sources in both parties.\\n\\nAsked if he expected the bill to pass Tuesday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN: “Hope so.”\\n\\nThe House took up the legislation after Johnson bucked conservatives in his party who opposed sending aid to Ukraine and threatened to oust him over his handling of the issue. In the end, the legislation was sent out of the House by a broad bipartisan margin.\\n\\nAid for Ukraine and Israel has been stalled after House and Senate Republicans demanded action on border security first, leading to months of negotiations in the Senate on a border package tied to foreign aid. However, former President Donald Trump led the opposition to the final deal, and Republicans ultimately discarded it.\\n\\nMcConnell, who has consistently broken with his party over backing Ukraine, described Tuesday’s vote as “overdue” and “a test, and we must not fail it.”\\n\\n“Here’s what I know to be true: American prosperity and security are the products of decades of American leadership,” McConnell said. “Our global interests come with global responsibilities. Healthy alliances lighten the burden of these responsibilities.”\\n\\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

CNN has requested comment from those agencies.\\n\\nHacking has long been one the sources of tension in the US-Iran relationship.

Tehran denied involvement.\\n\\nIn the indictment unsealed Tuesday, Hossein Harooni, Reza Kazemifar, Alireza Shafie Nasab and Komeil Baradaran Salmani were charged with wire and computer fraud, among other charges. Nasab had been charged in a previous indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York in February.\\n\\nThe men are all in their 30s and remain at large, according to the Justice Department.\\n\\nProsecutors accused three of the men of working for a front company in\\xa0Iran\\xa0that purported to offer cybersecurity services.\\n\\nThe Treasury Department on Tuesday announced sanctions on the four men while accusing them of being affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is part of Iran’s armed forces.

American officials have resisted, citing both supplies and further provoking Moscow as excuses.\\n\\nBut US officials have been describing the situation on the Ukrainian battlefield in increasingly dire terms over the last several months, as US aid stalled amid gridlock in Congress over the administration’s $60 billion supplemental funding request.\\n\\nCIA Director Bill Burns testified\\xa0earlier this month\\xa0that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of this year without US support, and the top US general for Europe, EUCOM commander Gen. Chris Cavoli, told Congress that the Russians have such an advantage in artillery ammunition that they will soon be outfiring the Ukrainians 10-to-1. Broadly, Russia has maintained a “significant quantitative advantage” over Ukraine in terms of munitions, manpower and equipment, a NATO official\\xa0said earlier\\xa0this month.\\n\\nSen. Mark\\xa0Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that\\xa0he hopes\\xa0ATACMS missiles\\xa0will\\xa0be sent to Ukraine by the end of next week.\\n\\n“It should have happened six months ago. The next best time is right now. This week, we’ve seen the Ukrainians overperform if you step back for a moment and think about the fact that for most of my life, most of America’s defense forces were focused on Russia,”\\xa0Warner\\xa0said. “Getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible, I hope once this gets to the President by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer range ATACMS.”\\n\\nThe package is also expected to include more desperately needed munitions for Ukraine, including\\xa0air defense and artillery ammunition, Bradley fighting vehicles and\\xa0demolition weaponry, the sources said.\\n\\nThe text of the legislation passed by the House and set to be approved by the Senate requires the administration to transfer the\\xa0coveted\\xa0longer-range ATACMS “as soon as practicable,” unless the president determines that doing so would be detrimental to US national security interests.\\n\\nThe military aid will be sourced from the US’ own stockpiles through a funding mechanism known as presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, and will be the first PDA package for Ukraine since March. It will be significantly larger than that package, however, which was worth\\xa0only\\xa0around $300 million that the Pentagon was able to scrounge together from cost savings elsewhere in the department.\\n\\nA White House official declined to comment on the contents of the PDA except to say that the US is “prepared to quickly send military aid to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield and air defense needs as soon as the supplemental passes the Senate and is signed into law.”\\n\\nUS European Command is now working to\\xa0process the weaponry so that once the Senate passes the aid,\\xa0it can flow into Ukraine as\\xa0efficiently as possible, officials told CNN. Once the funding is passed, the Pentagon can begin to transfer the aid “within a week or two,” Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told lawmakers earlier this month.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

NYU said it asked for help from the NYPD after school officials said there were “intimidating chants and several antisemitic incidents” during a protest. That led to scenes of a chaotic confrontation between protesters and police in full riot gear. The NYPD official said the demonstrations weren’t violent overall, except for a few bottles thrown at police officers.\\n\\nAt Yale University, at least 45 people were arrested and charged with trespassing on Monday after refusing to leave an on-campus protest, police said.\\n\\nFacing a “dangerous and volatile” situation, officials at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt decided to close the campus through Wednesday and move to remote classes “for the safety of the campus community.” Protesters there barricaded themselves inside a building on campus.\\n\\nPro-Palestinian encampments have also been set up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Emerson College, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. Nine people were arrested Tuesday morning at the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus after they formed an encampment that violated school policy, the university told CNN.\\n\\nHarvard University has closed Harvard Yard and officials at the university suspended a pro-Palestine student organization for allegedly violating school policies, according to the student group and a source with knowledge of the suspension.\\n\\nOfficials at Columbia and other universities are facing intense pressure from all sides.\\n\\nPro-Palestinian protesters and their supporters – sometimes including faculty – are condemning crackdowns on protests and free speech, while from some students, parents, donors and lawmakers are pleading with administrators to take new steps to restore order.\\n\\nMembers of the Columbia chapter of the American Association of University Professors are expected to move for a censure of Shafik and other university officials for the decision last week to ask the NYPD to arrest protesters on campus, the student-run news outlet Columbia Daily Spectator and Bwog reported.\\n\\nAt the same time, several lawmakers, including a\\xa0contingent of Jewish representatives, visited the campus Monday and argued the university’s lack of action against the protesters may be violating Title IX, a law that protects students from discrimination and harassment based on their race or nationality. Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, the chairwoman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, has warned university leaders of consequences if they do not rein in the protests.\\n\\nOrganizers say pro-Palestinian protesters plan to rally at the gates of Columbia on Tuesday afternoon.\\n\\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, US Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Tuesday he is “deeply concerned” about incidents of antisemitism at Columbia and pointed to the department’s previously opened civil rights investigation.\\n\\n“Antisemitic hate on college campuses is unacceptable,” Cardona said. “While we can’t comment on pending investigations, every student deserves to feel a sense of safety and belonging at school. Hate has no place at our schools.”\\n\\nLIVE UPDATES: Protests at Columbia and other schools escalate\\n\\nJewish student: ‘We feel safer off campus than on it’\\n\\nProtesters at Columbia are calling for the university to divest its funds from companies that profit from Israel’s war with Gaza and sever ties with Israeli universities, according to an Instagram post from Columbia University Apartheid Divest, one of the organizing groups. They are also demanding the university release a public statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\\n\\nIn recent days, the on-campus demonstrations have attracted non-university-affiliated protesters to the campus gates, which student organizers have sought to distance themselves from.\\n\\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tuesday that authorities have identified “outside agitators” causing problems at the mostly peaceful student protests at Columbia, NYU and other schools in the city.\\n\\n“We can’t have outside agitators come in and be disruptive,” he said, adding that officials “strongly believe” that has been happening.\\n\\nShafik, the Columbia president, said in her statement issued shortly after 1 am ET on Monday that the on-campus tensions have been “exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.”\\n\\nAs the protests continue, a growing sense of unease has spread among Columbia’s Jewish community, particularly as they enter the approximately weeklong observation of Passover, a major Jewish holiday celebrating freedom.\\n\\nInbar Brand, an Israeli and Jewish student at Columbia, expressed frustration with how university officials have handled the situation.\\n\\n“Columbia prefers to disrupt the expensive educations of tens of thousands of students in their last week of classes over clearing the illegal and violent local occupation of a few hundred,” Brand told CNN in an email.\\n\\nJacob Schmeltz, a senior at Columbia, told CNN he typically celebrated Passover on campus, but has chosen to go home for the holiday this year.\\n\\n“Jewish students have had enough, and it’s gotten to the point that we feel safer off campus than on it,” he said.\\n\\nHagar Chemali, an adjunct associate professor of international and public affairs at the university, told CNN, “If I had my child at Columbia, I also would tell them to go home.”\\n\\n“It’s not just because of the tension on campus, it’s also because those protests on campus have invited extremists outside,” Chemali said, referring to non-student protesters who have been demonstrating near the campus.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in their Resolution of Censure against Shafik, members of the American Association of University Professors accuse her and other university officials of violating “the fundamental requirements of academic freedom” and accuse an “unprecedented assault on students’ rights,” the Columbia Daily Spectator and Bwog reported.\\n\\nShafik “ignored the opinions of the faculty and students on the Senate Executive Committee who unanimously rejected her request to summon armed New York City police onto our campus” and “falsely claimed” the students arrested posed a “clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the University,” the resolution submitted Monday said, according to Bwog.\\n\\nThe university’s general counsel, chief operating officer and the co-chairs of the Board of Trustees were also included in the resolution, Bwog reported.\\n\\nThe group isn’t calling for Shafik’s resignation but would like a “recommitment to our core values on the part of our President, her administration, and the Board of Trustees.”\\n\\n“We want to work with her. We want her and her administration to turn back from the road that they’ve started down last week,” David Lurie, president of the Barnard and Columbia chapter of AAUP and professor of Asian humanities, told the Spectator.\\n\\n“President Shafik is focused on de-escalating the rancor on Columbia’s campus. She is working across campus with members of the faculty, administration, and board of trustees, and with state, city, and community leaders, and appreciates their support,” a Columbia University spokesperson told the New York Times.\\n\\nCNN has reached out to the university for comment and the AAUP for additional information.\\n\\nWhat it’s like inside the encampment\\n\\nColumbia’s West Lawn has become the epicenter of the university’s protest movement as it has become occupied by an encampment hosting scores of tents sheltering pro-Palestinian students and some allies from neighboring Barnard College.\\n\\nOn Monday, the encampment was quiet – a stark contrast from the outspoken protesters gathered outside the university’s private campus, whose chants included, “I believe that we will win” and “Long live the Intifada.”\\n\\nA smaller group of pro-Israeli protesters had also gathered Monday, chanting “Down with Hamas” and “Victory to Israel.”\\n\\nDozens and dozens of tents lined the student encampment Monday, where tables were piled with supplies of clothes, food and hygiene products. The day’s program included teach-ins, poetry readings and film screenings. Some students were\\xa0quietly finishing assignments, while others were painting posters.\\n\\nSigns along the perimeter read, “End the siege on Gaza now” and “Welcome to the People’s University of Palestine.”\\n\\nHowever, Democratic House Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey\\xa0described the encampment as “full of protesters spewing incendiary antisemitic hate and vitriol.” Gottheimer was among a group of Jewish lawmakers who visited the campus Monday, including Democratic Reps. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Dan Goldman of New York and Kathy Manning of North Carolina.\\n\\nElsewhere around campus, students were eating and completing assignments, and some walked down the street in graduation gowns, seemingly to take graduation photos. Risers are set up for an upcoming commencement ceremony.\\n\\nStudents arrested at Yale and NYU protests\\n\\nAs the demonstrations at Columbia have stretched on, smaller protests – some with their own encampments – have emerged at several major colleges and universities across the country.\\n\\nThe dozens of students arrested at Yale Monday morning “will be referred for Yale disciplinary action, which includes a range of sanctions, such as reprimand, probation, or suspension,” the university said.\\n\\nThe demonstrators were “advocating for Yale’s divestment from military weapons manufacturers,” a university spokesperson said.\\n\\nThe arrests at NYU Monday night came during a demonstration outside its business school near Washington Square Park.\\n\\nAn initial protest of about 50 people began Monday morning, NYU spokesperson John Beckman said in a\\xa0statement.\\n\\n“The University closed access to the plaza, put barriers in place, and made clear that we were not going to allow additional protesters to join because the protests were already considerably disruptive of classes and other operations in schools around the plaza.”\\n\\nAdditional protesters – many the university believe were not affiliated with NYU – pushed through barriers and joined the demonstration Monday afternoon and the school witnessed “disorderly, disruptive, and antagonizing behavior,” the school said.\\n\\nIn a letter to the NYPD, NYU said the demonstrators refused repeated requests to leave and the school requested that police clear the protesters, whom the school considered trespassers, according to a copy of the letter shared by\\xa0Deputy Police Commissioner of Operations\\xa0Kaz Daughtry.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

But her latest press tour is, well, a grand slam.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, the actor has been promoting her new movie “Challengers,” in which she plays a tennis star-turned-coach who must navigate her husband’s career on the courts as he prepares to face his former best friend (and her ex-boyfriend).\\n\\nAnd as has become perhaps all-too-expected, her looks have been a symbiotic mix of “method dressing” and personal style — from campy details like tennis balls on her heels to elegant pleated gowns that call to mind classic tennis whites. Zendaya is also on the May covers of both American and British “Vogue,” though neither of the magazine’s shoots delved too deeply into the sportswear space.\\n\\n“We are constantly trying to be inspired by the film, whether that be literally — like this morning, I had tennis balls in my shoes — or more just the essence of a character, or a concept, or an idea,” Zendaya said of the visual storytelling she and her long-term “image architect” Law Roach have sought to achieve in her interview with US Vogue.\\n\\nOnlookers have come to expect this attention to detail from the duo. Earlier this year, for example, while touring for “Dune: Part Two,” Zendaya’s looks consistently paid homage to the film and its sci-fi dystopia — most notably, she stepped out in an archival (and yet inherently futuristic) Thierry Mugler space suit at the movie’s London premiere.\\n\\n“What she allows me to do is to come up with the big story, the big idea, and she takes that and she whittles it down a bit,” Roach told British Vogue.\\n\\nScroll to see Zendaya’s best looks from the “Challengers” press tour. This gallery will continue to be updated.\\n\\nDuring the “Dune: Part Two,” press tour, Zendaya’s co-stars, including Florence Pugh, Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet, matched her commitment to the sartorial ‘bit’ with their own red carpet wardrobes. But for “Challengers,” actors Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist have played things a little safer, for the most part in the slouchy menswear suiting space. That’s with one subtle exception, however: At the film’s London premiere, O’Connor wore under his suit jacket a white T-shirt with the phrase “I TOLD YA” printed front and center, a nod to a piece Zendaya’s character Tashi wears in the movie.\\n\\nAt the Rome premiere two days earlier, the fashion designer (and Loewe creative director) Jonathan Anderson — who designed many looks in the movie — had also worn a version of the tee.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

As of Tuesday morning, they still aren’t.\\n\\nResearchers looking to track the evolution and spread of H5N1 say the information that was posted —\\xa0raw data on a US server — isn’t very useful and is anything but transparent.\\xa0They also say the government’s release of information in the outbreak, which was confirmed in cattle almost a month ago, has been painfully slow.\\n\\nAfter Sunday’s announcement by the USDA, Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and vaccine researcher who led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority from 2016 to 2020, said he immediately called his contacts at the database, called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or GISAID, to make sure he wasn’t missing something.\\n\\n“I said ‘Look, just tell me: Do you have data?’ and they said ‘No,’” Bright said.\\n\\nAfter checking even parts of the database where people can post rough drafts of sequences prior to full public release, Dr. Lucas Freitas, a Brazilian data scientist who is the GISAID curation lead, confirmed there are no new sequences posted by the USDA since its announcement.\\n\\n“We wouldn’t miss it,” said Peter Bogner, founder and president of GISAID.\\xa0“H5 is the reason GISAID came about to begin with. It raises antennas.”\\n\\nThe highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 has decimated bird populations around the world, and in recent years, has moved into a growing variety of mammals, raising concern that it’s a step closer to becoming a virus that can spread efficiently in people.\\n\\nWhen the USDA confirmed that H5N1 had been detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas on March 25, the news put infectious disease experts on alert, and they were eager to get more information to see how the virus had changed to target a new host. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, says H5N1 has now been found in 32 herds in eight states.\\n\\nBut weeks have gone by, and little data on the US outbreak has been shared with the global scientific community.\\n\\nIn its notice posted Sunday, APHIS said it had shared 239 genetic sequences from the H5N1 outbreak “from cattle, cats, chickens, skunk, racoon, grackle, blackbird, and goose.”\\n\\nThe agency said it “routinely publishes” on GISAID, but in the interest of public transparency and “ensuring the scientific community has access to this information as quickly as possible …” it was “also rapidly sharing” sequences to a US database maintained by the National Library of Medicine.\\n\\nThe announcement suggested to many scientists that the information would be found in GISAID, which has been critical to tracking the evolution of the virus that causes Covid-19 as it moves around the world. Many countries, including the United States, use GISAID to quickly share genetic sequences — the exact order of four chemical building blocks that make up the blueprints of each virus.\\n\\nInstead, the USDA uploaded raw sequencing data, called FASTQ files, to the National Library of Medicine database, which is available to the public.\\xa0These FASTQ files, however, lack the critical information necessary to help scientists track the evolution of the virus, such as the exact date the sample was collected and what state it came from.\\n\\nScientists do use raw data when tracking the evolution of a virus, but they also typically use it in concert with the type of information that is typically posted to GISAID: consensus sequences, known as FASTA files, which have been refined and cleared of contamination and mistakes. Consensus sequences typically give more information about where the sample was collected and when, helping researchers better understand how a virus is changing over time.\\n\\nResearchers say it’s not clear how recently the samples that are the basis for the raw data were taken.\\xa0The only dates posted say “2024,” and the locations are only listed as “USA.”\\xa0There’s no information on how the samples were obtained — whether they come from swabs of an animal’s respiratory tract its skin, or somewhere else.\\n\\nIn response to emailed questions from CNN, Shilo Weir, a public affairs specialist for USDA, said the agency had posted the raw data to the US server in the interest of speed and said the agency would work quickly to get curated sequences to GISAID.\\n\\n“APHIS typically posts curated sequence data on the GISAID platform. However, in order to make sequence data public as soon as possible, APHIS uploaded these unanalyzed sequence data files to NCBI,” Weir wrote in the emailed response.\\n\\n“These sequences will not be curated before posting, but this approach will allow us the most rapid path to posting sequence information. APHIS will continue to work as quickly as possible to publish to GISAID curated files that incorporate and analyze relevant epidemiologic information along with the sequence data,” Weir said.\\n\\nIt’s also not clear whether the latest release represents all the genomes the agency has.\\n\\nDr. Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the USDA was making a mistake by not sharing all the information it has as quickly as possible.\\n\\n“There’s a whole community around the world of people like me and my colleagues, who have a lot of experience with this and often can see things or do analyses that might show something that others have missed,” Worobey said.\\n\\n“You don’t want essentially one group to be the only ones looking at the data. You want everyone, all the experts around the world to be able to do that,” Worobey added.\\n\\nDr. Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said USDA’s public release of the raw data was a step in the right direction, but it didn’t go far enough.\\n\\n“The additional information would be quite useful for the public and for scientists and public health agencies, research organizations to understand all of the data that has been collected so far, what farms have been tested, when they were tested, what the sampling strategy is, overall, what kind of testing is going on now, around the country,” he said.\\n\\n“Now that we know that there are asymptomatic cows that have tested positive, what’s the strategy to understand the extent to which cows are infected that don’t have symptoms in other herds? Because I think the most important objective here is to get a full picture of the outbreak.”\\n\\nInfluenza viruses change quickly and have caused some of the most devastating pandemics throughout history.\\n\\n“What we’re seeing right now is chapter one of the book that keeps people like me and many infectious disease epidemiologists up at night,” said Dr. Michael Mina, who is chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.\\n\\nThe Covid pandemic was bad, but Mina said a pandemic caused by this virus could be worse.\\n\\n“The genie is not out of the bottle yet, and that’s a good thing,” Mina said, but given the potential consequences of letting the virus spread unchecked, “It’s a little bit hard to suggest we could be doing too much right now.”\\n\\nScientists have followed H5N1 for roughly two decades as it ripped through populations of wild and domestic birds and more recently marine mammals like sea lions, but human-to-human spread after contact with animals has been sporadic and not sustained, suggesting the virus has not mutated enough to become a fully human pathogen. There’s been no evidence of person-to-person spread in the current US outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nHumans have been infected after contact with animals, however — a chilling reminder that the virus still has us in its sights and requires close monitoring.\\n\\n“It’s so critical that the US government is being as transparent as they can right now, overly transparent, and sharing all of these sequences and all of this data so the world can look at it and make their own risk assessments and start making their own vaccine if they need to in their own countries instead of waiting for the United States to say what’s good and what’s bad,” said Bright, who is CEO of Bright Global Health in Washington, DC.\\n\\n“What would we say if this particular virus did get out of control?” Bright said. “Would we look back on this last two or three months and say: ‘I wish we would have done something else; I wish we would have been more transparent; I wish we would have shared all these sequences so the world can get ready for this?’”\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

       " Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nFederal labor board has been much more pro-worker under Biden. Employers want courts to end that\\n\\nBy Chris Isidore and John Fritze, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        1:06 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nStarbucks and the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency charged with protecting workers’ rights, will battle each other before the Supreme Court Tuesday, in one of numerous cases now pending in which major employers are questioning the NLRB’s powers and even its right to exist.\\n\\nThe NLRB under the labor-friendly Biden administration has been overseeing a period of significantly more organizing and strike activities by the nation’s unions. Some high-profile companies are complaining that the agency is abusing its powers. The companies are asking federal courts, often with conservative, pro-business judges, to stop the agency from standing behind the more activist unions now making their lives more difficult.\\n\\nTuesday’s Supreme Court case involves the NLRB’s powers to get employees whom it judges were wrongly fired for union activity immediately rehired, rather than forcing them to go through a long, drawn-out court process. At issue are\\xa0seven employees Starbucks fired at a store in Memphis in 2022 that the union said were attempting to organize. The employees, known as the “Memphis 7,” have become a nationwide symbol for labor supporters.\\n\\nStarbucks is arguing that the NLRB’s powers are not being applied uniformly across the country because some federal courts, including the courts that reviewed the Memphis 7 case, are using what critics describe as a\\xa0more lenient standard to force employers to take preliminary action. In this case, the lower courts required Starbucks to reinstate the employees it had fired.\\n\\n“The NLRB has long used the federal courts … to obtain injunctions … before the merits of an unfair labor practice case are fully evaluated,” said a statement from Starbucks. “As a company, we felt obligated to stand up for what is right, not only for our partners and our company, but also for the employers across the country who are subject to NLRB requests for injunctions in federal courts.”\\n\\nBut the NLRB argues that the only way to protect workers who are improperly terminated for union activity is to allow it to go to federal court and get immediate action against the offending employer, as it successfully did in the case of the Memphis employees.\\n\\n“Injunctive relief\\xa0is one of the most important tools available to the NLRB to protect workers’ statutory rights through effective enforcement of the only federal labor law in the country,” said Jennifer Abruzzo, the NLRB’s General Counsel, in a statement about the case.\\n\\n“Congress … has empowered the agency to seek this interim relief to immediately end violative conduct and restore the status quo at the workplace while the board’s administrative process proceeds,” Abruzzo said. “Without obtaining this temporary relief, the lawbreaker will fully reap the benefits of having violated workers’ rights — such as by snuffing out a nascent organizing drive — through the passage of time.”\\n\\nJustices’ tough questions for the NLRB\\n\\nDuring arguments Tuesday, Starbucks’ attorney argued that the NLRB has too much power to get an injunction to order fired workers returned to work, without the district court getting to weigh evidence in the case itself.\\n\\n“Preliminary injunctions are extraordinary and drastic remedies,” said Lisa Blatt, a veteran Supreme Court litigator and Starbucks’ attorney in the case. “Such relief is highly inappropriate absent a clear showing.”\\n\\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned how\\xa0the NLRB\\xa0could be abusing its powers, as Starbucks was arguing,\\xa0given that\\xa0there had been only 14 instances of the board seeking such injunctions in the last year out of the thousands of cases it considered.\\n\\n“If we’re worried about an abusive board doing things it’s not supposed to be [doing], giving undue deference, it seems like the board is pretty careful when it’s determining whether or not to even seek these injunctions since it’s only asked for it 14 times,” she said.\\n\\nBut both conservative and liberal justices posed tough questions to the government, pressing the Biden administration’s attorney on why lower courts should review labor cases any differently than other controversies involving government agencies.\\n\\n“The district court is an independent check,” conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett said. “So, it seems like it should be just doing what district courts do.”\\n\\nJustice Elena Kagan, a member of the court’s liberal wing, appeared to agree, suggesting that lower federal courts should do “what courts normally do, which is applying the law as the court finds it to a case.”\\n\\nThose questions appeared to cut against the arguments raised by the government that courts should give some special deference to the NLRB’s read on a dispute between employers and employees.\\n\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative member of the court, pointed out that “in all sorts of alphabet soup agencies, we don’t do this. District courts apply the likelihood of success test as we generally perceive it. So why is this particular statutory regime different from so many others?”\\n\\nAnd Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that attorneys for both the government and Starbucks could agree, “we can dispose of this in a short opinion,” prompting laughter in the courtroom.\\n\\nThe labor law that controls what happens if an employer illegally fires a worker for supporting a union doesn’t give the workers much in the way of relief. The employer could be forced to provide back pay for the time since the improper firing, but that amount would be reduced by whatever pay the worker received at a job they held in the meantime. The employer doesn’t have to pay any interest, penalty or fine, to the fired workers, their union or the agency.\\n\\n“The remedies against the employer are so pathetically weak they’re almost an invitation to violate the law,” said Cathy Creighton, an NLRB attorney during the Clinton administration and a union lawyer who now serves as the head of the Buffalo, New York office of Cornell University’s school of Industrial and Labor Relations.\\n\\nWhile this is the first such case to reach the Supreme Court, other cases are emerging in which some high profile employers are challenging the agency’s right to exist. The Supreme Court’s decision is expected by the end of June.\\n\\nOther challenges to NLRB\\n\\nRocket company SpaceX filed two federal lawsuits so far this year questioning the constitutionality of the agency itself after the NLRB announced it was looking at complaints from eight former employees of the nonunion rocket company who said they were fired for writing company management begging them to publicly condemn CEO Elon Musk’s “harmful” behavior on social media.\\n\\nThree other companies — Starbucks, Amazon and Trader Joe’s — have raised similar arguments in cases still before the NLRB’s administrative law judges, although they have not taken the case to federal court as SpaceX has done and have not joined its suit.\\n\\nThe constitutionality of the NLRB was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937, two years after the agency was created during the New Deal, said Cornell’s Creighton.\\n\\nShe said the Supreme Court’s rulings with the current conservative majority on some other cases involving unions makes her worried that it is poised to rule against the agency on this case. And she’s also worried that if the question of constitutionality of the NLRB were to reach the high court, it could rule against the agency as well.\\n\\n“They’re seeking to annihilate the board,” she said about the employers’ challenges to the NLRB. “I’m worried because this court is not ruled by precedent the way other courts have been. Just taking up the issue, they’re signaling they’re not particularly labor friendly.”\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

       " Document(page_content='CNN\\n\\n4/23/2024\\n\\nBusiness\\n    /\\n\\nTech\\n\\nGoogle has fired 50 employees after protests over Israel cloud deal, organizers say\\n\\nBy Catherine Thorbecke, CNN\\n\\nUpdated: \\n        12:09 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024\\n\\nSource: CNN\\n\\nGoogle has fired an additional 20 workers that it says were involved in protests last week over the company’s cloud-computing contract with the Israeli government, bringing the total number of workers fired to 50, according to the group organizing the demonstrations.\\n\\nNo Tech for Apartheid, the organizers of the protest at Google offices last Tuesday, said in a statement Monday evening that Google had fired an additional 20 workers, on top of the 30 workers terminated last week.\\n\\nNo Tech for Apartheid claims that some of the workers fired were “non-participating bystanders” during last Tuesday’s sit-in protests at Google’s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, and not actively involved in the workplace activism. The statement decried the mass firings as “an aggressive and desperate act of retaliation” by the tech giant.\\n\\nA Google spokesperson declined to share exactly how many workers had been terminated because of the protests but confirmed additional firings had taken place in a statement to CNN on Tuesday morning.\\n\\nGoogle had conducted an investigation into the “physical disruption inside our buildings on April 16,” the spokesperson said. “Our investigation into these events is now concluded, and we have terminated the employment of additional employees who were found to have been directly involved in disruptive activity,” the Google spokesperson added.\\n\\n“To reiterate, every single one of those whose employment was terminated was personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings. We carefully confirmed and reconfirmed this,” the Google spokesperson said.\\n\\nThe organizers of the protest, meanwhile, say that some of the workers fired did not cause any disruption inside Google offices.\\n\\n“Google is throwing a tantrum because the company’s executives are embarrassed about the strength workers showed at last Tuesday’s historic sit-ins, as well as their botched response to them,” the No Tech for Apartheid group said in a statement. “Now, the corporation is lashing out at any worker that was physically in the vicinity of the protest—including those who were not at all involved in the campaign.”\\n\\nThe worker group also vowed to continue its workplace activism at Google, saying they hope to send a message to company executives that: “We will not stop fighting, and we will not back down.”\\n\\nThe protests from Google workers over the company’s cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government come more than six months since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants left some 1,200 dead in Israel, and as Israel’s counteroffensive attacks in Gaza have now killed at least 34,097 people in Gaza, according to the latest tally from the Palestinian health ministry. More than 70% of those killed in Gaza have been women and children, according to the ministry.\\n\\nThe ongoing civilian carnage in Gaza has deeply divided the American public, and massive protests over US government and business support for Israel have erupted on college campuses and across corporate America in recent weeks.\\n\\nLast week, in the wake of the protests at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai sent a company-wide memo to staffers urging them to keep “politics” out of the workplace. The chief executive told workers that “this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers.” Pichai went on to urge Googlers to not “fight over disruptive issues or debate politics” in the workplace.\\n\\nSee Full Web Article\\n\\nGo to the full CNN experience\\n\\n© 2024 Cable News Network.
